# Scavenger Hunt
This is a component of a scavenger hunt activity for learning your way around Unix, git, archive formats, etc.

To get started, you'll see that this repository contains a file ending
in .tar

Tar is the classic Unix archiving program. It's short for "tape
archive". Tapes were (and in some places still are) the primary
archive solution for bulk storage. They're only barely random access
devices, so traditional file systems don't work well for them (we'll
learn more about this later in the Semester). So the Tar format is, in
effect, the file system for tapes, and now later, for bundling
multiple files into one file.

$ man tar

will tell you how to use the tar command to unpack a tar file (usually
called a "tarball" because it sounds funnier).
